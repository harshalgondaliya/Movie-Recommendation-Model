# Movie-Recommendation

# üé¨ Movie Recommender System

A modern, interactive movie recommendation system built with Streamlit and powered by TMDB dataset. This application helps users discover new movies based on their preferences and selected genres.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Essential Project File
The similarity matrix file (`similarity.pkl`, ~176MB) is **ESSENTIAL** for this project to function properly. Without this file, the movie recommendation system will not work. Please follow these steps to set up the model:

1. Download `similarity.pkl` from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x5BKOKwmlP1Ysh10vl8oIHXqx0msO8p4/view?usp=drive_link)
2. Place the downloaded file in the root directory of the project
3. Make sure the file is named exactly as `similarity.pkl`

## Data Files
This project uses several pickle files for storing movie data and similarity matrices:

1. `movie_list.pkl`: Contains the list of movies
2. `movies.pkl`: Contains movie details and metadata
3. `similarity.pkl`: Contains the similarity matrix for movie recommendations

To generate these files, run:
```python
python data_preprocessing.py
```

Note: Make sure you have the required movie dataset before running the preprocessing script.
